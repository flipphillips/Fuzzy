# Fuzzy
Fuzzy operators for Mathematica.

## Historical Things
Approximately 1.2 billion years ago, I created a set of fuzzy operators for the [Derive computer algebra system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derive_(computer_algebra_system)), running on my [HP-95LX pocket computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX). It was the coolest thing since [sliced bread](http://www.cnn.com/TECH/ptech/9903/08/toaster.y2k.idg/).

I also ported it over to [Mathematica 1.0](http://www.mathematica25.com) at the time (running on a Sun II in my office at Pixar).

I was doing a thing last week, now 25+ years later, where I needed to do Fuzzy Boolean operators, so I dug it out, cleaned it up and here we are. (It was on a tape cart  ☞ floppy ☞ Syquest ☞ Zip Drive ☞ CD ROM ☞ DVD ROM ☞ Synology. Let's hear it for pack-rattery.)

## Usage Notes
Sadly, this is no replacement for the super cool `FuzzyLogic` [Mathematica package](http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/TechNotes/4626/) (RIP).

It is simply the ten fuzzy boolean operators + a few things here and there that add to the fun. It implements the traditional 'Zadeh' operators, along with  Yager and HyperbolicParaboloid variants, selectable with `Method`.
